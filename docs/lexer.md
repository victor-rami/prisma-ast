This code defines the tokens for a lexer using the Chevrotain library. Each token has a name, pattern, and optionally other properties like label, categories, and push_mode. The tokens are then grouped into modes, with each mode containing a different set of tokens. The lexer is then created using the multi-mode token definition.

- `Identifier`: A token that matches any valid identifier in the language, consisting of a letter followed by zero or more letters or digits.
- `Datasource`: A token that matches the string "datasource" and enters the "block" mode when matched.
- `Generator`: A token that matches the string "generator" and enters the "block" mode when matched.
- `Model`: A token that matches the string "model" and enters the "block" mode when matched.
- `Enum`: A token that matches the string "enum" and enters the "block" mode when matched.
- `True`: A token that matches the string "true" and acts as a longer alternative for Identifier.
- `False`: A token that matches the string "false" and acts as a longer alternative for Identifier.
- `Null`: A token that matches the string "null" and acts as a longer alternative for Identifier.
- `Comment`: A token that matches no text and is used as a base token for categories.
- `DocComment`: A token that matches a comment starting with /// and is categorized as a Comment.
- `LineComment`: A token that matches a comment starting with // and is categorized as a Comment.
- `Attribute`: A token that matches no text and is used as a base token for attribute categories.
- `ModelAttribute`: A token that matches the string "@@" and is categorized as an Attribute.
- `FieldAttribute`: A token that matches the string "@" and is categorized as an Attribute.
- `Dot`: A token that matches the "." character.
- `QuestionMark`: A token that matches the "?" character.
- `LCurly`: A token that matches the "{" character.
- `RCurly`: A token that matches the "}" character and pops the current mode.
- `LRound`: A token that matches the "(" character.
- `RRound`: A token that matches the ")" character.
- `LSquare`: A token that matches the "[" character.
- `RSquare`: A token that matches the "]" character.
- `Comma`: A token that matches the "," character.
- `Colon`: A token that matches the ":" character.
- `Equals`: A token that matches the "=" character.
- `StringLiteral`: A token that matches a string literal in the language, enclosed in double quotes and with support for escape sequences.
- `NumberLiteral`: A token that matches a numeric literal in the language, with support for decimal points and scientific notation.
- `WhiteSpace`: A token that matches any whitespace character and is skipped by the lexer.
- `LineBreak`: A token that matches any line break character and is categorized as a LineBreak.

The tokens are grouped into two modes - the "global" mode which contains all the base tokens plus the mode-switching tokens, and the "block" mode which contains all the base tokens plus the tokens specific to each block type. The defaultMode property is set to "global". The multiModeTokens object defines the modes and the tokens in each mode. Finally, the lexer is created using the Lexer class and the multiModeTokens object.
